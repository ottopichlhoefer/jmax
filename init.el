;; This is a starter kit for jmax. This package provides a customized setup for
;; emacs that we use daily for scientific programming and publication.

;;; Code:

(when (version< emacs-version "24.4")
  (warn "You probably need Emacs 24.4. You should upgrade. You may need to install leuven-theme manually."))

;; we load the user/preload.el file if it exists. This lets users define
;; variables that might affect packages when they are loaded, e.g. key-bindings,
;; etc... In particular, this is needed for setting some key-bindings in
;; jmax-bibtex. Also, you can turn off jmax-auto-update here.

;; robust if the user has changed jmax, since we do not check if your
;; repo is clean.
